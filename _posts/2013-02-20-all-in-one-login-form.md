Some times ago I decided to redesign a webchat I use to communicate with friends. The site was getting old and so the design. There were two versions of the app, one for desktop browser and one for mobile phone. There was no consistency between these two. The site was created to be fast but I thought some rewrite of the template, the css or even the js could make it even better. I started my work on it... then the work of [Alex Pankratov](http://swappedcc.com/) came back to my mind and I decided to take some inspiration from it.

Alex aims to provide pretty straightforward interfaces such as the one created for [Bvckup2](http://bvckup2.com/). His shots on [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/apankrat) are also very interesting and show many possibilities of designs he tried which came to life or not, but there is always something to learn.

The old design was, pretty much, the basic login form. Two input fields, a checkbox for the option of keeping the conenction alive upon a browser restart and a big button for completing the login action. The form was also using the FamFamFam icons. Everything is represented in the figure below.

Below is an animated gif of the login form in action.
